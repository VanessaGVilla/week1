    <h1> About me</h1>
    <p> Creating & designing graphic images into photo cards, photography, and content writing for 
        web sites were hobbies turned into business circa 2009. An online web site was created once
        my photo card designs began to sell, in 2010. My e-commerce website was called, "Lil Sweet
        Prince". I designed (using Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom) hundreds of different layouts,
        (birth announcements, engagement annhouncements, weding invitations, etc.),for customers
        to view, select, provide their photos and info for me to customize, edit, and create.
