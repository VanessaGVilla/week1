    <h1> Hello World!</h1>
<body>
    <p><b>"What do you hope to learn in your CSS course?"</b></p>
    <p> I would like to expand on the basic foundation of HTML and CSS from my previous course, 
    COMP 001A Web Development. Acquiring the knowledge to build and understand the fundamentals 
    of the web is priority. If I can undertand how HTML & CSS work together, it's one step closer
        to being able to develop the framework of designing a website.</p>
        <br>
        <h2> Learning beyond HTML</h2>
        <p> Expanding my basic CSS knowledge is key to creating optimized, user friendly web sites. 
         Familiarizing myself with CSS hopefully prevents future struggles with design. I would
            like to stay away from basic cookie cutter templates, and create stand alone sites. </p>
           <br>
     <h3> Without CSS, websites would be unoriginal</h3>
         <p> As CSS adds presentation to a website, this course will challenge and teach me beyond 
             the fundamentals. Creating sub menus, tiered menus, designing easy and effective navigation,
             are styles I would like to feel comfortable with.
            </p>
